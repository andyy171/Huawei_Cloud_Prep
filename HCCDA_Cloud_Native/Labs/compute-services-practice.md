- Click Next

### Step 4: Confirm and Submit

- Review all settings
- Select checkbox: I have read and agree to the Image Disclaimer
- Click Submit

### Step 5: Monitor Image Creation

- Switch to Private Images tab
- Image status will show creation progress
- Completion time: 10-20 minutes (depending on image size)
- Status changes to Normal when complete

**Modifying Image Information**
### Step 1: Access Image Modification

- Locate your created image in Private Images list
- Click Modify in the Operation column
### Step 2: Update Image Details

- You can modify:
+ Image name
+ Description
+ Minimum memory requirements
+ Other configuration details

- Save changes when complete
**Replicating an Image Within a Region**
### Step 1: Initiate Replication

- In Private Images list, locate your image
- Click More > Replicate in Operation column
### Step 2: Configure Replication

- Enter new name for the replicated image
- Do not select KMS encryption (for this exercise)
- Click OK to confirm

**Creating ECS from Private Image**
### Step 1: Apply for Server

- In Private Images list, locate your image
- Click Apply for Server in Operation column
### Step 2: Verify Image Selection

- On ECS purchase page, ensure your private image is selected
- Complete ECS creation process as before
### Step 3: Verify New ECS

- Return to ECS list to view the new ECS created from your private image
- The new ECS will have all the configurations from your original Windows ECS

Prerequisite: Use the ecs-linux ECS created previously

## Creating a Linux System Disk Image from an ECS
**Configuring a Linux ECS**
### Step 1: Remote Login to ECS
Log in to the Linux ECS using SSH or VNC remote login

### Step 2: Configure DHCP for Network Interface
1. Edit the network configuration file:

```bash
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
```
2. Ensure the following parameter is present:

ls -lh /Cloud*
```
- If files are listed, the plugin is installed (default for public images)

### Step 4: Verify Cloud-Init Installation

- Check if Cloud-Init is installed:

```bash
rpm -qa | grep cloud-init
```
- If no output is displayed, install Cloud-Init:

```bash
yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
yum install cloud-init
```
### Step 5: Check Network Rule Files
